What to calculate

#Shooting (for both home and away team)
FG%
FT%
3P%
EFG% (one of four factors) ((FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA)

#Record
W% overall (for both home and away team)
Average points spread overall (for both home and away team)
Opp ppg (for both home and away team)
W% home (for home team)
W% away (for away team)
Av points spread home (for home team - drop away for home team)
Av points spread away (for away team - drop home for away team)
Home point spread var (for home team)
Away point spread var (for away team - drop away for home team and home for away team)

#Others (for both home and away team)
Turnover percentage (from four factors) (TOV / (FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV))
Free throw factor (from four factors) (FT/FGA)
Avg possessions (pace) - (FGA - ORB + TOV)

For when I wake up:
1. Finish prediction module - use it on test data
2. Table coefficients
3. Table/graph diff rmses from models I tried
4. Viz residuals and distribution of predictions vs. actuals
5. Viz scatter matrix for whichever model i use
5. Readme
 - Fun images
 - Random selection of games and find vegas lines
 - Prediction of a single tournament
 - Prediction of games against those lines
 - Next steps (logistic, gambling, incorporation of more features, Markov chains)
6. Source file and file cleanup
7. If time:
  - Viz of coefficient paths.
